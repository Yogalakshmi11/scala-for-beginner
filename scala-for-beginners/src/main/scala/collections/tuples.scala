object tuples extends App{
//  n Scala, tuples are immutable, ordered collections of elements of different types. They provide a convenient way to group together multiple values into a single object. Tuples are commonly used when you need to return multiple values from a function or when you want to temporarily group related data without defining a custom class.
  //
  //Here's a basic overview of tuples in Scala:
  //
  //Syntax:
  //Tuples are created using parentheses () enclosing comma-separated values.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val tuple: (Int, String, Double) = (42, "hello", 3.14)
  //Accessing Elements:
  //You can access individual elements of a tuple using 1-based indexing or pattern matching.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val firstElement = tuple._1 // Accessing the first element
  //val secondElement = tuple._2 // Accessing the second element
  //val (a, b, c) = tuple // Using pattern matching to extract elements
  //Type Inference:
  //Scala provides type inference, so you can omit the types of tuple elements if they can be inferred.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val tuple = (42, "hello", 3.14) // Type inference
  //Arity:
  //The arity of a tuple refers to the number of elements it contains. Scala supports tuples of various arities, from Tuple1 to Tuple22.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val singleElementTuple = (42,) // Tuple1
  //val twoElementTuple = (1, "two") // Tuple2
  //Immutability:
  //Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once the tuple is created. However, you can create new tuples with modified elements if needed.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val modifiedTuple = tuple.copy(_2 = "world") // Creating a new tuple with the second element modified
  //Pattern Matching:
  //Tuples are often used with pattern matching to destructure them and extract their elements.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //tuple match {
  //  case (x, y, z) => println(s"Elements: $x, $y, $z")
  //  case _ => println("Unknown tuple")
  //}
  //Tuples are lightweight and convenient for temporary grouping of values, but they lack named accessors and can lead to less readable code when used extensively. For more complex scenarios, consider defining case classes or using other data structures that provide more meaningful access to data.

  //In the context of tuples in Scala, "arity" refers to the number of elements contained within a tuple. The term is commonly used to describe the size or dimensionality of a tuple. Scala supports tuples of various arities, ranging from Tuple1 to Tuple22. Here's an explanation of arity and its significance:
  //
  //Tuple1 to Tuple22:
  //Scala provides pre-defined tuple types up to arity 22 (Tuple1 to Tuple22). Each tuple type represents a fixed-size collection of elements with a specific number of components.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val tuple1: Tuple1[Int] = Tuple1(42) // Tuple with one element
  //val tuple2: (Int, String) = (1, "hello") // Tuple with two elements
  //// ...
  //val tuple22: (Int, String, Double, ..., Boolean) = (1, "hello", 3.14, ..., true) // Tuple with 22 elements
  //Tuple Elements:
  //The arity of a tuple determines the number of elements it can contain. For example, a Tuple3 contains exactly three elements, while a Tuple2 contains two elements, and so on.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val tuple3: (Int, String, Double) = (1, "hello", 3.14) // Tuple3 with three elements
  //Choosing the Right Arity:
  //When choosing the arity of a tuple, consider the number of values you need to group together. For instance, use a Tuple2 for pairs of values, a Tuple3 for triples, and so on.
  //It's essential to strike a balance between clarity and convenience. Using tuples with high arity (e.g., Tuple22) can lead to less readable code due to the lack of meaningful names for elements.
  //Pattern Matching:
  //Arity is crucial when pattern matching on tuples because you need to match the correct number of elements to extract their values.
  //scala
  //Copy code
  //val tuple: (Int, String) = (42, "hello")
  //tuple match {
  //  case (x, y) => println(s"First element: $x, Second element: $y")
  //  case _ => println("Unknown tuple")
  //}
  //Type Safety:
  //Scala's type system ensures type safety by enforcing the correct arity for tuples. Attempting to assign or match tuples with different arities will result in a compilation error.
  //Overall, understanding the arity of tuples helps you choose the appropriate tuple type for grouping your data and ensures that your code remains clear, concise, and type-safe.
